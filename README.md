Project Name: Conversational AI meets Object Detection
Project ID: 118

Name: Prathamesh Bende
Roll no. : 23b0408

Goal: Enable AI to be able to interact with real-life

Experience: The mentors were very helpful, professional, and intuitive. Gave us hints wherever necessary. 

Things I got to learn under this project:
WSL, GitHub, YOLO, RASA, RAG, LLM, NLP, LMU.

The final project accepts an image/video as input and identifies it using a trained YOLOv8 model. 
The identified fruit is given as context to the GEMINI API used and then the conversation with the Gemini model begins!
It is able to solve any query you might have about the fruit.
